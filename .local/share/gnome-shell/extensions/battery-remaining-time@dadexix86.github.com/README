######       Battery Remaining Time extension for gnome-shell          #######

This extension show the time remaining of your battery near the icon. 
It shows the time remaining to full discharge when unplugged and the time to 
full charge when plugged to AC.

There is a first attempt to manage multiple batteries, but I don't know if 
it works because my laptop has only one.

There are other options available, look under here in *SETTINGS*

Please report any bug and issue to 
        https://github.com/dadexix86/battery-remaining-time/issues

while), by mail to

All the settings are now update to gsettings and are 
configurable via the gnome-shell-extension-prefs.

They are 7.

If true show the icon near the text. (default: ON)
Unfortunately, needs reload to show the icon again after disabling it.

This needs reload because some debug messages are shown before settings.


*Credits*
This extension for gnome-shell was once based on the battery-percentage-indicator
extension by paravoid.
In time I used a lot of code borrowed from some other extensions.
