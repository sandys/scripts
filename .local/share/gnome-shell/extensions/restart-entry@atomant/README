This is the restart-entry extension, a very simple GNOME Shell extension that
adds a "Restart Shell..." functionality with a confirmation dialog to the user's
menu. The dialog also contains an option that lets users reload the current
theme only, without having to restart the whole Shell.

In case you didn't get your copy of this extension from github, you can find its
original repository at the following url:
